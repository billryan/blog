# Transparent routing for home server in China

Since this post is sensitive in China, I will roll it with English instead. 

## ChinaDNS and WiFi(AP)

From [DNS Server for home server](../../2014/11/cubieboard2-dns-server.html), we have set up with ChinaDNS and can resolv the external websites correctly. You can see a file including China IP in `/etc/chnroute.txt`. This file is very important for ss-rules. In [Access Points for home server](../../2016/07/Access-Points-for-home-server.html), we have built a AP and can assign the clients with DHCP and Unbound DNS Server backend.

## ss-redir

Now we can make full use of ss-redir and ss-rules to route all the traffic outside China to our VPS. First, make sure you have a high speed and reliable ss service. ss-redir is included in shadowsocks-libev port, install shadowsocks-libev in Arch is easy.
```
packer -S shadowsocks-libev
```

ss-redir configuration is the same with ss-local,
```
{
    "server": "your_ss_server",
    "server_port": your_ss_port,
    "local_address": "0.0.0.0",
    "local_port": 8484,
    "password": "your_ss_password",
    "timeout": 60,
    "method": "your_ss_encrypt_method"
}
```

Save it and move it to `/etc/shadowsocks/redir.json`, start ss-redir service.
```
sudo systemctl start shadowsocks-libev-redir@redir.service
sudo systemctl enable shadowsocks-libev-redir@redir.service
```

## ss-rules

Thanks to @aa65535, he wrote the ss-rules scripts and works well with ss-redir. You can refer [Instruction of ss rules](https://github.com/shadowsocks/openwrt-shadowsocks/wiki/Instruction-of-ss-rules) for detailed info.

Download the ss-rules scripts from [openwrt-shadowsocks/shadowsocks.rule](https://github.com/shadowsocks/openwrt-shadowsocks/blob/master/files/shadowsocks.rule).
```
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ss-rules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadowsocks/openwrt-shadowsocks/master/files/shadowsocks.rule
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ss-rules
```

In case of TCP networking error, we should exclude our ss server. If you have only one ss server, save the following systemd service and move it to `/etc/systemd/system/ss-rules.service`.

```
[Unit]
Description=ss-rules Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ss-rules -s your_ss_server_ip -l 8484 -i /etc/chnroute.txt
ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/ss-rules -f

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start it and enable.
```
sudo systemctl start ss-rules
sudo systemctl enable ss-rules
```
